Description: 

Basically I have implemeted the microsoft strategy to create the project architecture where I every module has specified role and responsibility through which whole project would depend. Intially it takes time but after while it would be fruitfull. Where We enviroment file, constant file, router file, controller and util which make modular and easy to understand flow when it's going scalable.
